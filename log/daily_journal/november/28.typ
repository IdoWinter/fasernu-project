Work done today:

Setup new mac.

Discussion with Enrique about project:
- Containment of $p_T$ reaches 100% only around radius $approx 3$ and there is a very large radius distribution of the jets.
- Want to find a variable with high correlation with the radius of the jet, so that we can improve the algorithm.
