Meeting summary:

- We decided that the best way forward is to find some observable that will let us distinguish between the 2 cases that we found. 
- Possible observables include the energy correlation functions, which might be able to tell us about the jet substructure (there could possibly be a difference in the jet substructure between the 2 cases).
- Another observable we could look at is something similar to N-subjettiness, but we expect that we are in a different case (we don't expect 2 vs 1 prong, but rather a different radius of the jet).
